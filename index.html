                <h3>Why do I Want to Join?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Catalyst program would be an amazing opportunity, and an engaging and fun, 
                    but also educational way to use a part of my summer. I would most look forward 
                    to meeting and working with many like-minded people. The collaborative aspects 
                    of this program seem like they would lead to various interesting conversations 
                    and ideas and would also further improve my collaboration skills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attending talks and workshops from Waterloo graduates and faculty is a very unique 
                    aspect of this program and I think that I would enjoy and learn a lot from it. This 
                    program would also be a great way to get a feel for university life, particularly 
                    because it focuses on STEM and leadership, which are fields that I’d like to look deeper
                    into. I plan to apply to an engineering program at the University of Waterloo and 
                    I think that this summer program would be a great chance to further explore 
                    engineering and related projects, as well as to get to know the university better. 
                </p>
                <h3>Why should you accept me?</h2>
                <p class="text-preview">
                    I think that I would be a great addition to this program for several reasons. First of 
                    all, as I mentioned in my <i>about me</i> video, I have participated in various STEM-related 
                    programs and have many technical skills, but I am also very keen to learn more. Creativity 
                    has always been one of my strengths, and I’ve used it for problem-solving as well as in 
                    projects. For example, I would often seek reading recommendations, but I found that most 
                    websites reviewed the same well-known books, so I channeled my creative energy and made a 
                    website featuring reviews of lesser-known books. 
                </p>
                    Apart from creativity, I’ve also developed 
                    effective collaboration and leadership skills from working with various groups of people at 
                    camps and events. The Catalyst program would be the ideal opportunity for me this summer, as 
                    I am very open-minded and eager to learn, so I know that I would get lots out of the experience.
                </p>
